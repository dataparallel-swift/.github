# Meet Data-Parallel Swift

Swift is a general-purpose programming language that is both approachable for
newcomers and powerful for experts. It is used to develop everything from apps
and system software to cloud services and embedded firmware, and runs on a
variety of platforms including macOS, Linux, and Windows.

Data parallelism is a parallelisation strategy that focuses on distributing the
data of a computation over the available processors, and is especially suited
for programming GPUs for general-purpose computations. This project enables
writing GPU kernels directly in the Swift programming language.
